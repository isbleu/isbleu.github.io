For the first time Venusian scientists managed to land a satellite on the planet Earth, and it has been sending back signals as well as photographs ever since. The satellite was directed into an area known as Manhattan (named after the great Venusian astronomer Prof. Manhattan, who first discovered it with his telescope 20,000 light years ago). Because of excellent weather conditions and extremely strong signals, Venusian scientists were able to get valuable information as to the feasibility of a manned flying saucer landing on earth. A press conference was held at the Venus Institute of Technology.", "answer": "本周金星上群情激动异常。金星上的科学家首次把一颗卫星成功地送上了地球，此后卫星便不断地发回信号和照片。 卫星对准发射的地区叫曼哈顿（是以金星上伟大的天文学家曼哈顿教授命名的，在两万光年之前该教授用望远镜首次发现了这个地区）。 由于天气条件极为有利，信号极为清晰，金星科学家们从而获得了有关载人飞碟能否在地球上着陆的宝贵资料。于是，有关方面在金星理工学院举行了一次记者招待会。" }

Of the guests, none except the American notices this or sees the boy place a bowl of milk on the veranda just outside the open doors. The American comes to with a start. In India, milk in a bowl means only one thing --- bait for a snake. He realizes there must be a cobra in the room.", "answer": "那个美国人没有参加这场争论，他只是注视着在座的其他客人。在他这样观察时，他发现女主人的脸上显出一种奇异的表情。她两眼盯着正前方，脸部肌肉在微微抽搐。她向站在座椅后面的印度男仆做了个手势，对他耳语了几句。男仆两眼睁得大大的，迅速地离开了餐室。在座的客人中除了那位美国人以外谁也没有注意到这一幕，也没有看到那个男仆把一碗牛奶放在仅靠门边的走廊上。那个美国人突然醒悟过来。在印度，碗中的牛奶只有一个意思 — 引蛇的诱饵。他意识到餐室里一定有条眼镜蛇。" }

He was an expert in agriculture, archeology, and medicine. He practiced crop rotation and soil conservation a century before these became standard practice, and he invented a plow superior to any other in existence. He influenced architecture throughout America, and he was constantly producing devices for making the tasks of ordinary life easier to perform. Of all Jefferson’s many talents, one is central. He was above all a good and tireless writer. His complete works, now being published for the first time, will fill more than fifty volumes. His talent as an author was soon discovered and when the time came to write the Declaration of Independence at Philadelphia in 1776, the task of writing it was his. Millions have thrilled to his words: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal …”", "answer": "杰斐逊的勇气和理想主义是以知识为基础的。他懂得的东西也许比同时代的任何人都要多。在农业、考古学、和医学方面他都是专家。在人们普遍采用农作物轮作和土壤保持的做法以前一个世纪，他就这样做了。他还发明了一种比当时任何一种都好的耕犁。他影响了整个美国的建筑业，他还不断地制造出各种器械装置，使日常生活中需要做的许多工作变得更加容易。在杰斐逊的众多才能中，有一种是最主要的：他首先是一位优秀的、不知疲倦的作家。目前正在第一次出版的他的全集将超过五十卷。他作为一个作家的才能很快便被发现了，所以，当1776年在费城要撰写《独立宣言》的时刻来到时，这一任务便落到了他的肩上。数以百万计的人们读到他写的下列词句都激动不已：“我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的：一切人生来就是平等的……”" }

        "question": "While I was waiting to enter university, I saw advertised in a local newspaper a teaching post at a school in a suburb of London about ten miles from where I lived. Being very short of money and wanting to do something useful, I applied, fearing as I did so, that without a degree and with no experience in teaching my chances of getting the job were slim.\n\nHowever, three days later a letter arrived, asking me to go to Croydon for an interview. It proved an awkward journey: a train to Croydon station; a ten-minute bus ride and then a walk of at least a quarter of a mile. As a result I arrived on a hot June morning too depressed to feel nervous.",
        "answer": "在我等着进大学期间，我在一份地方报纸上看到一则广告，说是在离我住处大约十英里的伦敦某郊区，有所学校要招聘一名教师。我因为手头很拮据，同时也想干点有用的事，于是便提出了申请，但是提出申请的同时我也担心，自己一无学位，二无教学经验，得到这份工作的可能性是微乎其微的。\n\n然而，三天之后，却来了一封信，叫我到克罗伊顿去面试。这一路去那儿原来还真麻烦：先乘火车到克罗伊顿车站，再乘十分钟的公共汽车，然后还要步行至少四分之一英里。结果，我在六月一个炎热的上午到了那儿，因为心情非常沮丧，竟不感到紧张了。",

He was the only person I knew who had come to terms with himself and the world around him. He knew what he wanted and he wanted only this: to understand within his limits as a human being the nature of the universe and the logic and simplicity in its functioning. He knew there were answers beyond his intellectual reach. But this did not frustrate him. He was content to go as far as he could.\n\nIn the 23 years of our friendship, I never saw him show jealousy, vanity, bitterness, anger, resentment, or personal ambition. He seemed immune to these emotions. He was beyond any pretension. Although he corresponded with many of the world’s most important people, his stationery carried only a watermark --- W --- for Woolworth’s.",

        "answer": "年复一年，海平面正在慢慢上升。它很可能继续上升，而在今后数百年间，会以更快的速度上升。在那些低洼的沿海地区（在这些地区居住着世界上很大一部分人口），海水会稳步向前推进，迫使人们向内陆退居。\n\n最后，海水将会高出目前海平面两百英尺，一阵阵海浪将会拍打曼哈顿摩天大楼二十层楼的窗户。佛罗里达将会沉没在海浪之下，英伦三岛的大部分，人口稠密的尼罗河流域，还有中国、印度河俄罗斯的低洼地区也都将遭到同样的命运。\n\n不仅许多城市将被淹没，而且世界上大部分盛产粮食的地区也将会失去。由于食品供应下降，到处都会出现饥荒，在这种压力下，社会结构有可能崩溃。",
